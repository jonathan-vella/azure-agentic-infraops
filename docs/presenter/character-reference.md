> _"The code works. The tests pass. But does it actually do what the business needs?
> That's the question that keeps me up at night."_

- **Background**: Senior QA Engineer, validation consulting
- **Motivation**: Bridge gap between technical testing and business outcomes
- **Pain Point**: Manual UAT is slow and error-prone

An enterprise customer needs a Software Bill of Materials—yesterday."
